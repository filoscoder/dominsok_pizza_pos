<h2>| About |</h2>
  <p><b>Dominsok's Pizza</b>, this project is an simple and ordinary POS (Point-Of-Sale) system including a little chart reports destinated to its owner. The main goal of the project is to provide a simple and easy system to manage the ordering and payments of an pizza sales point.<br/>
  <br/>
  This project was initialy with <b>Qt Designer</b>, but I decided to write it all plain with <b>Tkinter</b> library. <br\>
  (Anyway there is a .ui file on the repository if you want to check it out!) <br\>
  <br\>
  
  The developing time was 3 days (with out knowing nothing about tkinter).
  This was made just for fun, I just want it to write some GUI programming on Python with some crawling stuff.
  <code>Result: Once more, I confirmed my vocation is not related deeply with the 'client-side'. <br\>
  And again, confirmed that I want to become a <b>Back-end Developer</b> <br/></code>
